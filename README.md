# 👋 Hi, I'm JJepaah

I’m a developer and tinkerer who enjoys building practical tools, experimenting with systems, and learning how things work under the hood.

## 🛠️ What I work with
- **Operating systems:** Linux
- **Hardware tinkering:** Raspberry Pi, home servers, 3D printers
- **Game development:** Unity (C#)
- **Automation & tooling:** CLI tools, small utilities, overlays

## 💻 Languages
- **C#** – game development with Unity
- **Perl** – scripting and automation
- **Python** – tools, prototypes, utilities
- **Bash** – Linux workflows and system tasks

## 🎮 Interests
- Game development & simulations
- Reverse engineering (learning-focused)
- Linux customization & window managers
- Automation tools for games (QoL, not cheating)
- 3D printing workflows and hardware control

## 📌 Current focus
- Improving Linux-based tooling
- Unity game prototypes (roguelike & simulator concepts)
- Learning reverse engineering fundamentals
